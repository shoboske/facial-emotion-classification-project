# Facial Emotion Classification Project

This project classifies emotions based on facial expressions.

## Description

In this study, we aim to design, implement, and evaluate a deep learning architecture capable of accurately classifying facial expressions into specified categories. This hands-on project provides valuable experience in applying deep neural network models to solve real-world multi-class classification problems.

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project. It can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or on Google Colab.
- `test.zip`: Contains data used in training the model.

## Dataset

For this project, we use the Facial Expression Dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains images of facial expressions categorized into seven distinct emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.

## Model Performance

The model achieved an average validation accuracy of 0.5677. This indicates that the model correctly classified 56.77% of the images in the validation set on average.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shoboske/facial-emotion-classification-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd facial-emotion-classification-project
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the code in `main.ipynb` to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
2. You can also run the notebook on Google Colab by clicking the link on the `main.ipynb` file or uploading the file and the dataset.
